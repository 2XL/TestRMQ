 # a function that the computer waits for results
 
 client (manager) and a scalable RPC server (dummy host)
 
 
 # dummy RPC service
 
 # misused RPC can result in unmaintainable spaghetti code.
 
 - consider the following advice:
 
 -- Make sure it's obvious which function call is local and which is remote.
 -- Document your system. Make the dependencies between components clear.
 -- Handle error cases. How should the client react when the RPC server is down for a long time?
